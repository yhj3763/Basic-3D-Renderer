It is project to make simple 3D renderer that can load object files and draw it into screen and there are also functions that can add some kind of lights

For the GUI, ImGui and ImGui-Addons are used.

For main parts of project, C++ and OpenGL are used.

In case of OpenGL, I studied and used some stuffs from https://learnopengl.com/
